# Hangman Game

Players are encouraged to try and guess the letters of a word selected at random, simply by stating which letter they want. A certain number of wrong guesses from the players end in defeat for those players.

## Features

- Pick a random word based on the length given by the user.

- Decides right or wrong with a scoring system.

## Prerequisites
